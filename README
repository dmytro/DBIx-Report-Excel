DBIx-Report-Excel version 0.1
=============================

DBIx::Report::Excel's goal is to make creating reports in MS Excel
format from database easy. It's aimed at SQL developers and/or DBA's
who don't know much about Perl programming. I.e. most of the
information needed to create Excel file is provided directly in SQL
statement (script) itself.

If SQL script contains multiple statements, resulting Excel file is
formatted as multi-page spreadsheet with each result set on it's own
worksheet.
